Simple plugin that allows you to ride some monsters

You can now sit on hostile mobs like zombie, skeleton and spider, and few more. By left clicking while looking in certain direction will make the mob move in that direction for a few seconds. Maybe you can make zombie races with this, idk. Hope you enjoy this :]
